    "movie_title – Name of the movie\n",

    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you select this data set?\n",
    "I selected this dataset because movie ratings are relatable, widely discussed, and offer a range of opportunities for statistical exploration. Rotten Tomatoes is one of the most influential platforms for movie reviews, and understanding critic vs. audience perspectives can reveal how different groups evaluate films. The dataset is large (15,000+ movies), diverse in features, and structured well for visual and statistical analysis. Additionally, the dataset allows for questions that stakeholders in the film industry such as production studios, streaming services, and marketing teams would care about. Insights like genre performance, audience engagement patterns, and factors influencing ratings can help in decision-making around content creation, budgeting, and promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between critic ratings and audience ratings?\n",
    "> - How do Tomatometer ratings vary across different genres?\n",
    "> - Does runtime influence how movies are rated?\n",
    "> - How do MPAA ratings (G, PG, PG-13, R) compare in terms of average audience rating and popularity?\n",
    "> - Do movies from certain studios tend to receive higher critic or audience ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Distributions of critic and audience scores (overall & by genre)\n",
    "Charts: Histograms / KDE plots of tomatometer_rating and audience_rating. Histograms or boxplots by genre (top 5–10 genres).\n",
    "Purpose: Show the overall shape of the ratings and which genres have tighter or wider spreads in scores\n",
    "\n",
    "> Critic vs audience agreement\n",
    "Charts: Scatter plot of tomatometer_rating vs audience_rating, with points colored by genre.\n",
    "Interactive Plotly scatter where hovering shows movie_title, genre, and studio.\n",
    "Purpose: Identify clusters (genres where critics and audience mostly agree) and outliers (movies audiences love but critics dislike, and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Runtime and ratings\n",
    "Charts: Scatter plot of runtime_in_minutes vs audience_rating and/or tomatometer_rating.\n",
    "Possibly bin runtimes (e.g., <90, 90–120, >120 minutes) and use boxplots to compare scores across bins.\n",
    "Purpose: Check if there is a trend (mid-length movies doing best) or if runtime doesn’t matter much once genre is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "> MPAA rating vs scores\n",
    "Charts: Grouped bar chart or boxplot of tomatometer_rating and audience_rating by rating (G, PG, PG-13, R, etc.).\n",
    "Purpose: Reveal which content ratings tend to be more positively received, and whether critics and audiences differ (maybe R-rated dramas are critic favorites but not audience favorites).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Studio comparison\n",
    "Charts:Bar chart of mean tomatometer_rating by studio_name (for studios with at least a minimum number of movies, e.g., > 20).\n",
    "Purpose: Show which studios are most consistent in producing highly-rated films, useful from a branding and partnership perspective.\n"
